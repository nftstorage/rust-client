## Product Decommission Notice

### Important Update

Hello from NFT.Storage!

As of June 30, 2024, we have officially decommissioned NFT.Storage Classic uploads. This means that NFT.Storage Classic, including NFTUp, the Classic web app, Classic APIs, Classic SDK, and Pinning API, will no longer accept new uploads/pins.

### What This Means for You

**Service Termination:** NFT.Storage Classic will no longer accept new uploads. However, retrieval of existing data remains operational.

**Data Access:** Don't forget, we're still keeping a copy of your NFT.Storage Classic data available in the NFT.Storage Gateway and in the decentralized Filecoin Network. However, over time, latency and availability may degrade.

**Support:** We’ll be working with the newly formed NFT.Storage community to determine what changes, if any, will impact NFT.Storage Classic data latency and availability in the future. Join the community [Join the community](https://nft.storage/join-us) to have your say. We will keep you informed by email and on Twitter/X.

### Transition to the New Version

For the new version of NFT.Storage, first mint your NFTs, then send us the NFT data—metadata and imagery CIDs, blockchain(s) minted on, contract address, and token IDs. We will preserve these in long-term Filecoin storage. Note that you need to upload the data to IPFS separately. Your NFTs will also be included in the NFT Token Checker, a tool for block explorers, marketplaces, and wallets to show verification that NFT collections, tokens, and CIDs are preserved by NFT.Storage.
